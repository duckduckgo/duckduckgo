DuckDuckHack Developer Overview
===
## What is this?

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a general purpose search engine. We've created a platform called [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com/) that enables developers to write open source plugins on top of the search engine (like [add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/?src=ss)). DuckDuckGo plugins react to search queries and provide [useful](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%40duckduckgo) [instant](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=roman+xvi) [answers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=private+ips) above traditional links.

If you want to get involved in making DuckDuckGo a better search engine, you've come to the right place! 

* If **you are a developer**, this guide serves as a master jumping-off point for the DuckDuckHack platform.
* If **you are not a developer**, but would like to become one to help with DuckDuckHack, we recommend the [JavaScript course at Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript). That will help you to get started with the Spice plugin type (explained below).
* If you have no intention of becoming a developer, there is still a lot you can do at our [ideas companion site](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/) where you can suggest and comment on plugin ideas such as identifying the best sites and data sources to draw from. Similarly, you can submit [issues about current plugins](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open). Both of these activities are very valuable and will help direct community efforts.

The DuckDuckHack platform is constantly changing as community contributors add new features. As a result, some plugin types have better interfaces than others. We will be improving the platform based on [your feedback](https://www.listbox.com/subscribe/?list_id=197814).
Our long-term goal is to be able to distribute all DuckDuckHack (and internal) instant answers via the [DuckDuckGo API](https://api.duckduckgo.com). 
Currently [fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead) and [goodie](#goodies-overview) plugin types 
automatically flow through. We are working on exposing the other plugin types, which are more complicated to distribute
and can have licensing restrictions.
