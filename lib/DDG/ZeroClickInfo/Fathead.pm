# ABSTRACT: DuckDuckGo server side used ZeroClickInfo Fathead result class

use Moo;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $zci_fathead = DDG::ZeroClickInfo::Fathead->new(
        title => 'Widget',
        type => 'A',
        categories => 'Products',
        abstract => 'The widget is the staple of any good business.',
        source_url => 'http://widg.et/amazingwidget.jpg',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the extension of the L<WWW::DuckDuckGo::ZeroClickInfo> class, how it
is used on the server side of DuckDuckGo. It adds attributes to the
ZeroClickInfo class which are not required for the "output" part of it.

=method new_via_output

Takes a line from output.txt, constructs a hash with the input array mapped to
the attributes of this package, and returns a new DDG::ZeroClickInfo::Fathead
object instantiated with that hash.

=cut

sub new_via_output {
    my @line = split( /\t/, $_[0] );

    my @fields = (
        'title',
        'type',
        'redirect',
        'otheruses',
        'categories',
        'references',
        'see_also',
        'further_reading',
        'external_links',
        'disambiguation',
        'image',
        'abstract',
        'source_url');

    # Uses the list of fields to construct a hash with the field
    # names as keys and the corresponding elements in the line as
    # the values
    my %params = map { $_ => shift @line || ''} @fields;

    # Delete undefined parameters so the attributes aren't set and
    # we can use the predicates later.
    foreach (keys %params) {
        delete $params{$_} if $params{$_} eq '';
    }

    return __PACKAGE__->new( %params );
}

=attr title

This is the title of the result. This is what the user must search, with the
possible addition of specific trigger words, to trigger this result.

=cut

has title => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_title',
);


=attr type

This is the type of result.

A for article (regular ZCI box)
R for redirect
D for disambiguation

=cut

has type => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_type',
);


=attr redirect

Only for type 'R' (redirect)

This is the title it should be directed to.

e.g. "Duck Duck Go" -> "DuckDuckGo"

=cut

has redirect => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_redirect',
);


=attr other_uses

Ignore.

=cut

has other_uses => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_other_uses',
);


=attr categories

You can put the article in multiple categories, and category pages will be 
created automatically.

e.g.: http://duckduckgo.com/c/Procedural_programming_languages

You would do: Procedural programming languages\\n

You can have several categories, separated by an escaped newline. Categories 
should generally end with a plural noun.

=cut

has categories => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_categories',
);


=attr references

Ignore.

=cut

has references => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_references',
);


=attr see_also

You can reference related topics here, which get turned into links in
the Zero-click Info box. On the perl example, e.g. Perl Data Language,
you would do:

[[Perl Data Language]]

If the link name is different, you could do: 

[[Perl Data Language|PDL]]

=cut

has see_also => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_see_also',
);


=attr further_reading

Ignore.

=cut

has further_reading => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_further_reading',
);


=attr external_links

You can add external links that get put first when this article comes out.
The canonical example is an official site, which looks like:

[$url Official site]\\n

You can have several, separated by an escaped newline, though only a few
will be used. You can also have before and after text or put multiple
links in one like this:

Before text [$url link text] after text [$url2 second link].\\n

=cut

has external_links => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_external_links',
);


=attr disambiguation

Only for type 'D' (disambiguation)

This is for searches that may benefit from one of many results, but the search
isn't specific enough to tell which the user is looking for. Disambiguations 
are a list of links to more specific searches. The format looks like this:

Search: "example"

*[[this example]], a brief summary\\n*[[that example]], another summary

=cut

has disambiguation => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_disambiguation',
);


=attr image

You can reference an external image that we will download and reformat
for display. You would do:

[[Image:$url]]

=cut

has image => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_image',
);


=attr abstract

This is the text in the ZCI box that should concisely explain the topic.

=cut

has abstract => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_abstract',
);


=attr source_url

This is the full URL for the source. If all the URLs are relative to
the main domain, this can be relative to that domain.

=cut

has source_url => (
    is => 'ro',
    predicate => 'has_source_url',
);
